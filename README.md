# So what's this?
This is AP Reference stuff I (Matt) made/am making for the 2020 exam. These are written and maintained by me to study for some exams, and they are used alongside some exams I've taken and will take this year. These reference documents will be updated whenever I have a notable improvement to make or whenever an error is found. If you find an error or have any suggestions, feel free to dm me on instagram [@mattpoteshman](https://instagram.com/mattpoteshman).
<br><br>I will not be updating exam reference during the exam. Additional updates may be made following the exam in case of more errors or general improvements.
