#### Aggregate Demand (AD)
The AD curve describes the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded by households (consumption), firms (investment), government (government spending), and the rest of the world (net exports), all equaling GDP!

The negative slope of the AD curve is explained by the following:
* Real Wealth Effect
    * Pising asset prices (in things like real estate or stock) make people feel wealthy, thus consumers spend more.
* Interest Rate Effect
    * When interest rates fall, consumers borrow more/keep money in hand and thus spend more.
    * When interest rates rise, consumers borrow less/leave more in banks and thus spend less.
* Exchange Rate Effect
    * when a change in the price level in one country leads to other countries purchasing more of that countryâ€™s goods. That makes net exports (and therefore real GDP) increase.

Any change in the components of AD (consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports) that is not due to changes in the price level leads to a shift of the AD curve.

#### Multipliers
##### Expenditure Multiplier
Quantifies the size of the change in aggregate demand as a result of a change in any of the components of aggregate demand.
* Formula: 1/(1-MPC) OR 1/MPS

##### Tax Multiplier
Quantifies the size of the change in aggregate demand as a result of a change in taxes.
* Formula: MPC/(1-MPC) OR (1-MPS)/MPS

##### Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
* The change in consumer spending divided by the change in disposable income. MPC + MPS = 1

* Expenditure and Tax multiplier depend on this

#### Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)
Describes the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services supplied in an economy.

The SRAS curve is __upward-sloping__ because of sticky-wages and prices

Any factor that causes production costs to change, such as a change in inflationary expectations, will cause the SRAS curve to shift.

Moving along the SRAS curve, an increase in price level is associated with an increase in output, which means employment must correspondingly rise. With the labor force held constant, unemployment will fall. So there is a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

---
#### Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)
All prices and wages are fully flexible, while in the short run some input prices are fixed. A consequence of flexible long-run prices and wages is tha lack of a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

The LRAS curve corresponds to the PPC because they both represent maximum sustaninable capacity. 

##### Maximum Sustainable Capacity
the total output an economic system will produce over a set period of time if all resources are fully employed.

The LRAS curve is _vertical_ at full employment level of output because in the long run wages and prices fully adjust.

---
#### Equilibrium in the AD-AS Model
Short-run equilibrium occurs when aggregate Q of output demanded and aggregate Q of output supplied are equal (at intersection of AD and SRAS curves)

Long-run equilibrium occures when the AD and SRAS curves intersect on the LRAS (at full emplotment level of real output)

The short-run equilibrium output can be at the full-employment level of output, above it, or below it, creating positive (inflationary) or negative (recessionary) output gaps.

---
#### Changes in the AD-AS Model in the Short Runn
A _positive_ shock in AD causes output, employment, and the price level to _rise_ in the short run. 

A _negative_ shock in AD causes output, employment, and the price level to _fall_ in the short run.

A _positive_ shock in SRAS causes output and employment to _rise_ and the price level to _fall_ in the short run.

A _negative_ shock in SRAS causes output and employment to _fall_ and the price level to _rise_ in the short run.

Inflation can be caused by changes in aggregate demand (__demand-pull__) or aggregate supply (__cost-push__)

---
#### Long-Run Self-Adjustment
In the long run, in the absence of government policy actions, flexible wages and prices will adjust to restore full employment and unemployment will revert to its natural rate after a shock to aggregate demand or short-run aggregate supply.

Shifts in the long-run aggregate supply curve indicate changes in the full-employment level of output and economic growth.

#### Fiscal Policy
##### Tools
* Government Spending
* Taxes/Transfers

Changes in gov spending affect AD directly and changes in taxes/transfers affect AD indirectly.

The gov spending multiplier is greater than the tax multiplier

_Expansionary_ or _contractionary_ fiscal policies are used to restore full employment when the economy is in a negative (recessionary) or positive (inflationary) output gap.

Fiscal policy can influence AD, real output, and the price level.

The AD-AS model is ued to demonstrate the short-run effects of this policy.

IRL there are lags because of the time it takes to decide on and implement a policy action

__Monetary Policy is in Unit 4 - Fiscal Policy__

#### Automatic Stabilizers
Automatic stabilizers support the economy during recessinos and help prevent the economy from being overheated during expansionary periods.

Tax revenues decrease automatically as GDP falls, preventing consumption and the economy from falling further.

Tax revenues increase automatically as GDP rises, slowing consumption and preventing the economy from overheating

Government policies, institutions, or agencies may also have social service programs whose transfer payments act as automatic stabilizers
