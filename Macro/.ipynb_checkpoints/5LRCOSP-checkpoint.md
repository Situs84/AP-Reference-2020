#### Fiscal and Monetary Policy Actions in the Short Runn
A combination of expansionary or contractionary fiscal and monetary policies may be used to restore full employment when the econnomy is in a negative (recessionary) or positive (inflationary) output gap.

A combination of fiscal and monetary policies can influence AD, real output, the price level, and interest rates.

#### The Phillips Curve
The short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment can be illustrated by the downward sloping short-run Phillips curve (SRPC)

An ecomony is always operating somewhere along the SRPC

The long-run relationship between inflation and unemployment can be illustrated by the long-run Phillips curve (LRPC), which is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment.

Long-run equilibrium corresponds to the intersection of SRPC and LRPC.

Points to the left of the long-run equilibrium represent inflationary gaps, while points to the right represent recessionary gaps.

Demand shocks correspond to movement along the SRPC.

Supply shocks correspond to shifts of the SRPC.

Factors that cause natural rate of unemployment to change will cause the LRPC to shift.

#### Money Growth and Inflation
Inflation results from increasing the money supply at too rapid of a rate for a sustained period of time.

Deflation results from decreasing the money supply at too rapid of a rate for a sustained period of time.

When the economy is at full employment, changes in the money supply have no effect on real output in the lonng run.

In the long run, the groupth rate of the money supply determinnes the groups rate of the price level (inflation rate) according to the quantity theory of money.

#### Government Deficits and the Nationnal Debt
The government budget surplus/deficit is the difference between tax revenues and government purchases plus transfer payments in a given year.

The government adds to the national debt when it runs a bidget deficit.

A government must pay innterest on its accumulate debt, thus increasing the nationnal debt annd increasinngly forgoing using those funds for alternative uses

#### Crowding Out
When a goverrnment is in budget deficit, it typically borrows to finance its spending.

A loanable funds market model can be used to show the effect of government borrowing on the equilibrium real interest rate and the resulting crowding out of private investment.

Crowding out refers to the adverse effect of incresed government borrowing, which leads to decreased levels of interest-sensitive private sector spending in the short run.

A potential long-run impact of crowding out is a lower rate of physical capital accumulation and less economic growth as a result.

#### Economic Growth
Economic growth can be measured as the growth rate in real GDP per capita over time.

Aggregate employment and aggregate output are directly relatec because firms need to employ more workers in order to produce more output, holding other factors cnostant. This is captured by the aggregate production function.

Output per employed worker is a measure of average labor productivity.

Productivity is determined by the level of technology and physical and human capital per worker.

The aggregate production function shows that output per capita is positively related to both physical and human capital per capita.

<u>An outward shift in the PPS is analogous to a rightward shift on the LRAS curve</u>

#### Public Policy and Economic Growth
Public policies that impact productivity and labor force participation affect real GDP per capita and economic growth.

Government policites that invest in infrastructure and technology affect growth.

Supply-side fiscal policies affect AD, AS, and potential output in the short run and long run by influencing incentives that affect household and businness economic behavoir.
