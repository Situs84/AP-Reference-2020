#### The Circular Flow and GDP
* GDP is a measure of final output of the economy
* As a total flow of income and expenditure, GDP can be represented by the __circular flow diagram__

There are three ways of measuring GDP

##### Limitations of GDP
GDP is a useful indicator of a nation's economic performance, but it has some limitations, such as failing to account for nonmarket transactions.

#### Unemployment
##### Unemployment Rate
The percentage of the _labor force_ that is out of work
##### Labor Force Participation Rate
Another measure of the labor market activity in an economy. It is the percentage of the _adult population_ that is in the _labor force_

###### Limitations of Unemployment Rate
* It is often criticized for understating the level of joblessness because it excludes groups such as _discouraged workers_ and _part-time workers_.

##### Types of Unemployment
* __Cyclical Unemployment__
    * Caused by contraction of the business cycle (recession/economic dip)
    * shown by deviationn in actual unnemployment rate from natural rate
* __Frictional Unemployment__
    * Caused when people are in-between jobs (left old job and haven't found new one yet)
* __Structural Unemployment__
    * Unemployment caused by a mismatch in skills jobs supplied and demanded

##### Natural Rate of Unemployment
* The unemployment rate that would exist when the economy produces full-employment real output
* __Natural Unemployment Rate = Frictional Unemployment + Structural Unemployment__
* Can gradually change over time because of changes in labor force characteristics

#### Price Indices and Inflation
##### CPI
* Measures the change in income a consumer would need in order to maintain the same standard of living over time under a new set of prices as under the original set of prices
* Measures the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services in a given year relative to the base year

* ###### Shortcomings
    * Substitution bias (can overstate the true inflation rate)
    
##### __Inflation Rate__
Determined by calculating the % change in a price index, such as CPI or the GDP deflator

##### Costs of Inflation
Unexpected inflation arbitrarily redistributes wealth from one group of individuals to another group, such as lenders to borrowers.
* If inflation rate increases unexpectedly
    * Borrowers benefit (value of money returned is less)
* If inflation rate decreases unexpectedly
    * Lenders benefit (value of money returned is more)

#### Real v. Nominal GDP
##### Nominal GDP
* A measure of how much is spent on output
* Measures aggregate output using current prices

##### Real GDP
* A measure of how much is produced
* Measures aggregate output using constant prices, thus removing the effect of changes in the overall price level.
* One way to measure is to weight final goods and services by their prices in a base year.

---
#### Business Cycles
* Fluctuations in aggregate output and employment because of changes in aggregate supply and/or aggregate demand.

##### Parts of the graph
* Phases
    * Recession
    * Expansion
* Turning Points
    * Peak
    * Trough
    
###### Output Gap = Actual Output - Potential Output
##### Potential Output
* Also called full-employment output
* level of GDP where unemployment = natural rate of unemployment
