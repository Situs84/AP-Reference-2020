#### Scarcity
Individuals and societies are forced to make choices because most resources are scarce.

Economic trade-offs arise from scarcity to meet societyâ€™s
__wants__ and __needs__.

Factors of production are scarce (Land, Labor, Capital), but established knowledge isn't because it is non-rival.

#### Production Possibilities Curve
* The PPC is a model used to show the trade-offs associated with allocating resources.
* The PPC can be used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, underutilized resources, and economic growth or contraction.
* The shape of the PPC depends on whether opportunity costs are constant, increasing, or decreasing.
* The PPC can shift due to changes in factors of production as well as changes in productivity/technology.
* Economic growth results in an outward shift of the PPC.

#### Comparative Advantage and Gains from Trade
##### Absolute Advantage
A situation in which an individual, business, or country can produce more of a good or service than any other producer with the same quantity of resources.
##### Comparative Advantage
A situation in which an individual, business, or country can produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another producer.
##### Production Specialization
Production Specialization according to comparative advantage results in exchange opportunities that lead to consumption opportunities beyond the PPC.
##### Terms of Trade
The interval between the opportunity costs for the production of a given good of two companies or nations.

#### Demand
##### Law of Demand
States that there is an inverse relationship between P and Q demanded, leading to a downward-sloping demand curve.

##### Determinants
Changes in determinants of consumer demand can cause the demand curve to shift
* Price
* Price of Related Goods
* Consumer Income
* Tastes and Preferences
* Advertisement expenditure
* Consumer Expectations

---
#### Supply
##### Law of Supply
States that there is a positive relationship between P and Q demanded, leading to a upward-sloping supply curve.

##### Determinants
Changes in determinants of producer supply can cause the supply curve to shift
* Price
* Price of Related Goods
* Cost of Inputs
* Technology
* Taxes and Subsidies

#### Market Equilibrium, Disequilibrium, and Changes in Equilibrium
__Equilibrium__ is achieved at the price at which quantities demanded and supplied are equal.

Whenever markets experience imbalances (creating disequilibrium prices, surpluses, and shortages) market forces drive prices toward equilibrium.

Changes in the determinants of supply and/or demand result in a new equilibrium price and quantity
