#### Nominal v. Real Interest Rates
##### Nominal Interest Rate
* The rate of interest paid for a loan, unadjusted for inflation
* Lenders and borrowers establish nominal innterest rates as the sum of their expected real interest rate and expected inflation.

##### Real Interest Rate
* Real Interest = Nominal Interest Rate - Actual Interest Rate

#### Definition, Measurement, and Functions of Money
Money is any asset that is accepted as a _means of payment_.

Money serves as the following
* Medium of Exchange
    * An intermediary instrument or system used to facilitate the sale, purchase, or trade of goods between parties.
* Unit of Account
    * The value of something is measured in a specific currency.
* Store of Value
    * The function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved.
    
The money supply is measured using monetary aggregates designated as M1 and M2

The <u>Monetary Base</u> (often labeled as M0 or MB) includes currency in circulation and bank reserves

#### Banking and the Expansion of the Money Supply
##### Depository Institutions (such as commercial banks)
* These institutions operate usinng fractional reserve banking.
* Banks' reserves are divided into required reserves and excess reserves.

__Excess Reserves__ are the basis of expansion of the money supply by the banking system.

The __Money Multiplier__ is the ratio of the money supply to the money base

The size of expansion of the money supply depends on the money multiplier.

The maximum value of the money multiplier can be calculated as the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio

The amount prodicted by the simple money multiplier may be overstated because it does not take into account a bank;s desire to hold excess reserves or the public holding more currency.

#### The Money Market
<br><img src="https://www.reviewecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Money_Market-1024x760.jpg" width=400px>

The demand for money shows the inverse relationship between the nominal interest rate and the quantity of money people want to hold.

Given a monetary base determined by a country's central bank, money supply is independent of the nominal interest rate.

In the money market, equilibrium is achieved when the nominal interest rate is such that the quantities demanded and supplied of money are equal.

Disequilibrium nominal innterest rates create surpluses and shortages in the money market. Market forces drive nominal interest rates toward equilibrium.

Factors that shift the demand for money (determinants), such as changes in the price level, and supply of money, such as monetary policy, change the equilibrium nominal interest rate.

#### Monetary Policy
Central banks implement monetary policies to achieve macroeconomic goals, such as price stability.

##### Tools of Monetary Policy
* Open-Market Operations (most used of the three)
    * Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury securities in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates.
    * When the central bank conducts an open-market purchase, reserves increase, thereby increasing the monetary base.
    * When the central bank conducts an open-market sale, reserves decreasem thereby decreasinng the monetary base.
* Required Reserve Ratio
    * A required reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that regulators require a bank to hold in reserves and not loan out.
* Discount Rate
    * The discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank's lending facility.
    
##### Federal Funds Rate
Policy by central bank to hit a target range for an overnight interbank lending rate.

Central banks can influence the nominal interest rate in the short runn by changing the money supply, which in turn will affect investment and consumption.

Expansionary or contractionary monetary policies are used to restore full employment when the economy is in a dengative (recessionary) or positive (inflationary) output gap.

Monetary policy cann influence AD, real output, the price level, and interest rates.

A money market model and/or the AD-AS model are used to demonstrate the short-run effects of monetary policy.

In reality, there are lags to monetary policy caused by the time it takes to recognize a problem in the economy and the time it takes the economy to adjust to the policy action.

#### The Loanable Funds Market
<br><img src="https://www.reviewecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Loanable_Funds_Market-1024x671.jpg" width=400px>

The Loanable Funds Market describes the behavior of savers and borrowers.

D<sub>LF</sub> shows the inverse relationship between real interest rates and the Q<sub>D</sub> of loanable funds.

S<sub>LF</sub> shows the positive relationship between real interest rates and the Q<sub>S</sub> of loanable funds.

In the absence of international borrowing and lending __national savings___ is the sum of public savings and private savings.

For an open economy, investment equals national savinngs plus net capital inflow.

In the LF market, equilibrium occurs when real interest rate is such that quantities demanded and supplied of loanable funds are equal.

Disequilibrium real interest rates create surpluses and shortages in the LF market. Market forces drive real interest rates toward equilibrium.

The LF market can be used to show the effects of government spending, taxes, and borrowing on interest rates.

Factors that shift the demand (such as an investment tax credit) and supply (such as changes in saving behavior) of loanable funds change the equilibrium interest rate and the equilibrium quantity of funds.
