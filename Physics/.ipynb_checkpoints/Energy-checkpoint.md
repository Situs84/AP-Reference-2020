# Energy
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)
__Energy is measured in Joules (J)__\
$K$, $E_k$, and $KE$ are all symbols for Kinetic Energy
<br>$U_g$ and $U$ are symbols for Gravitational Potential Energy
<br>$U_s$ is a symbol for Spring Potential Energy
#### Open and Closed Systems: Energy
For all systems under all circumstances, energy, ~~charge,~~ linear momentum, and angular momentum are conserved.

An interaction can be either a force exerted by objects outside the system or the transfer of some quantity with objects outside the system.
#### Work and Mechanical Energy
Change in kinetic energy ($\Delta E_k$) of an object depends on force exerted and displacement of the object.

$\Delta E_k = W = F_\parallel d= Fd\cos(\theta)$
*  Net force exerted on an obect _perpendicular_ to the direction of     displacement of the object can change the direction of the object     __*without*__ changing the kinetic energy of the object

$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
<br>$E_k = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$
<br>$U = mg\Delta y$
<br>$F_G=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}$
<br>$U_s=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$

#### Conservation of Energy, the Work-Energy Principle, and Power

$T_p = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$
* Period of a pendulum given length $l$ and gravity $g$ (positive).
* Period of a pendulum is determined only by the strength of the gravitational field at its current position and the length of the pendulum

$T_s = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$ 
* Period of a string given mass $m$ and Spring Constant $k$.

$U_s=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$
* Potential Energy of a Spring given displacement $x$ and Spring Constant $k$ (elastic).

$\Delta U_g = mg \Delta y$ 
* Change in Gravitational Potential Energy given mass $m$, gravity $g$, and vertical positional change $\Delta y$.
