# Momentum
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)
#### Momentum and Impulse
$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$
#### Representations of Changes in Momentum
$\vec{p}=\vec{F}\Delta{t}$
#### Open and Closed Systems: Momentum
* In a closed system, the linear momentum is constant throughout the collision, plus kinetic energy stays the same if the collision is elastic.

In an elastic collision: __both momentum and energy__ are conserved\
In an inelastic collision: __only momentum__ is conserved because you are losing energy through work
