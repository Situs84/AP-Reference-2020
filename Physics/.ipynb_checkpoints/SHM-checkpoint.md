#### Period of Simple Harmonic Oscillators
Restoring forces can result in oscillatory motion.
When a linear restoring force is exerted on an
object displaced from an equilibrium position,
the object will undergo a special type of motion
called simple harmonic motion. Examples of this are pendulums and mass-spring oscillators when force is exerted on them by gravitational forces

$\star$__For a spring that exerts a linear restoring force, the period of a mass-spring oscillator increases with mass and decreases with spring stiffness.__
<br>$\star$__For a simple pendulum, the period increases with the length of the pendulum and decreases with the magnitude of the gravitational field__

$T_p = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$
<br>$T_s = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$
#### Energy of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator
$U_s=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$
<br>$\Delta U_g = mg \Delta y$

#### Wavelength/Frequency
$\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$\
$\lambda$ - Wavelength\
$v$ - Speed\
$f$ - Frequency
