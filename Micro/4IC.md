#### Intro to Imperfectly Competitive Markets
Imperfectly competitive markets include:
* Monopoly
* Oligopoly
* Monopolistic Competition
* ~~Monopsony~~ (not on exam)

In imperfectly competitive output markets and assuming all else is constant, a firm must lower price to sell additional units.

Consumers and producers _respond_ to prices that are above the MCs of production and/or marginal benefits of consumption (i.e. P > MC)

Incentives to enter an industry may be mitigated by __barriers to entry__, which sustain imperfectly competitive market structures:
* high/fixed start-up costs
* legal
* exclusive ownership of key resources

---
#### Monopoly
* Exists because of barriers to entry.
* Profit-maximizing equilibrium is determined by finding MR=MC. P is greater than MC.
* In a natural monopoly, long-run economies of scale for a single firm exist throughout the entire effective demand of its product

---
#### Price Discrimination
* A firm with market power can engage in price discrimination to increase its profits or capture additional consumer surplus under certain conditions
* In __perfect price discrimination__, a monopolist produces the Q where P=MC (as a competitive market would) but extracts all economic surplus and eliminates all deadweight loss.

#### Monopolistic Competition

In a market with monopolistic competition, firms producing differentiated products may earn positive, negative, or zero economic profit in the short run. Firms typically use advertising as a means of differentiating their product. Free entry and exit drive profits to zero in the long run. Output is smaller than the output level needed to minimize ATC, creatin __excess capacity__. P>MC, creating allocative inefficiency.

#### Oligopoly and Game Theory
##### Oligopoly
An inefficient market structure with high barriers to entry, where there are few firms acting interdependently

Firms in an oligopoly have an incentive to collude and form __cartels__

##### Game Theory
A game is a situation in which a number of individuals take actions, and the payoff for each individual depends directly on both the individual's own choices and _the choices of others_.

A strategy is a complete plan of actions for playing a game; the normal form model of a game shows the payoffs that result from each collection of strategies (one for each player)

A player has a __dominant strategy__ when the payoff to a particular action is always higher independent of the action taken by the other player. Dominant strategies can be eliminated from each player's action set and can sometimes lead to an equilibrium outcome

A __Nash equilibrium__ is a condition describing the set of actions in which no player can increase his or her peyoff by unilaterally taking another action, given the other players' actions.
