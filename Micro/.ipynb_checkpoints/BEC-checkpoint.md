# Basic Economic Concepts
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)
#### Scarcity
Economic trade-offs arise from scarcity to meet societyâ€™s
__wants__ and __needs__.

Factors of production are scarce (Land, Labor, Capital), but established knowledge isn't because it is non-rival.
#### Resource Allocation and Economic Systems
* What goods and services to produce?
* How to produce goods and services?
* Who consumes these goods and services?

The above are significantly indfluenced depending on economic system (command, market, mixed economy)
#### Production Possibilities Curve
* The PPC is a model used to show the trade-offs associated with allocating resources.
* The PPC can be used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, underutilized resources, and economic growth or contraction.
* The shape of the PPC depends on whether opportunity costs are constant, increasing, or decreasing.
* The PPC can shift due to changes in factors of production as well as changes in productivity/technology.
* Economic growth results in an outward shift of the PPC.
