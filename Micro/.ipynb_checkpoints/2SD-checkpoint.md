#### Demand

Individuals often respond to incentives, such as those presented by prices, but also face constraints, such as income, time, and legal and regulatory frameworks.

The market demand curve (schedule) is derived from the summation of individual demand curves (schedules).

##### Law of Demand
As price _increases_, quantity demanded _decreases_, and vice versa.
* demand curve slopes downwards because of this.

##### Determinants
Changes in determinants of consumer demand can cause the demand curve to shift
* Price
* Price of Related Goods
* Consumer Income
* Tastes and Preferences
* Advertisement expenditure
* Consumer Expectations

#### Supply
The market supply curve (schedule) is derived from the summation of individual supply curves (schedules).

##### Law of Supply
As price _increases_, quantity supplied _increases_, and vice versa.
* supply curve slopes upwards because of this.

##### Determinants
Changes in the determinnants of supply can cause the supply curve to shift
* Price
* Price of Related Goods
* Cost of Inputs
* Technology
* Taxes and Subsidies

#### Price Elasticity of Demand
Elasticity is a concept used to measure the magnitude of percentage change in quantity owing to any given changes in the price, income, and prices of related goods.

Elasticity varies along the linear demand curve, meaning slope is not elasticity

##### When elasticity > 1
* Demand is elastic
* When Q increases by %x and P changes by %y, %x > %y 

##### When elasticity = 1
* Demand is unit elastic
* When Q increases by %x and P changes by %y, %x = %y 

##### When elasticity < 1
* Demand is inelastic
* When Q increases by %x and P changes by %y, %x < %y 

##### When price changes
The impact of a given price change on total revenue or total expenditure will depend on whether demand is elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic

#### Price Elasticity of Supply
Elasticity is a concept used to measure the magnitude of percentage change in quantity owing to any given changes in the price, income, and prices of related goods.

![% chg Qs / % chg P](images/pqs-pp.png)

Elasticity varies along the linear demand curve, meaning slope is not elasticity

##### When elasticity > 1
* Supply is elastic
* When Q increases by %x and P changes by %y, %x > %y 

##### When elasticity = 1
* Supply is unit elastic
* When Q increases by %x and P changes by %y, %x = %y 

##### When elasticity < 1
* Supply is inelastic
* When Q increases by %x and P changes by %y, %x < %y

#### Other Elasticities
Elasticity can be measured for any determinant of demand or supply, not just the price.
##### Income Elasticity of Demand
###### __Income = Y__

\
Determines whether a good is normal or inferior
###### YED > 0
Normal Good
###### YED > 1
Luxury Good
###### YED < 0
Inferior Good
##### Cross-price Elasticity of Demand

###### CPED is negative
Complements
###### CPED is positive
Substitutes

#### Market Equilibrium and Consumer and Producer Surplus
In a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium is achieved when P brings Qs and Qd into balance.

Economists use __consumer surplus__ (upper triangle) and __producer surplus__ (lower triangle) to measure the benefits markets create to buyers and sellers and understand market efficiency.

Market Equilibrium maximizes total economic surplus in the absence of market failures, meaning that perfectly competitive markets are efficient.

#### Market Disequilibrium and Changes in Equilibrium
Whenever markets experience imbalances (creating disequilibrium prices and quantities, surpluses and shortages), market forces drive price and quantity toward equilibrium.

Factors that shift the market demand and market supply curves cause P, Q, consumer surplus, producer surplus, and total economic surplus (within the market) to change. The impact of this change depends on PED and PES.

#### The Effects of Government Intervention in Markets
* Price Floors (line above equilibrium)
* Price Ceilings (line below equilibrium)
* Taxes
* Subsidies

Government intervention can only decrease allocative efficiency

Burden of regulations depends on Elasticity of Supply and Elasticity of Demand.

#### International Trade and Public Policy
Equilibrium can change when markets are opened to trade with other countries, and the gap between domestic supply demand is filled with trade. Opening to trade affects Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, and Total Economic Surplus.

Tariffs can be used to influence international trade to affect domestic price, quantity, government revenue, and consumer surplus and total economic surplus.
