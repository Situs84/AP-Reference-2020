##### **Productive Efficiency** (long run) occurs where D=P=min ATC
##### **Allocative Efficiency** (long run and short run) occurs where D=Price=MC
##### A change in fixed costs only shifts the AFC and ATC (up w/ increase, down w/ decrease)
* Example: Lump-sum tax

##### A change in variable costs shifts the AVC, ATC, and MC (up w/ increase, down w/ decrease)
* Example: Per-unit tax

#### **Perfect Competition** from short-run loss to long-run equilibrium
The economic loss causes firms to exit the industry, shifting the supply curve left, raising the price (MR=D=AR=P) until the firm breaks even.

#### **Perfect Competition** from short-run profit to long-run equilibrium
The economic profit causes firms to enter the industry, shifting the supply curve right, lowering the price until the firm breaks even.

#### Pure or Single Price Monopoly
1. Firm will charge where MR=MC at quantity M and go up to the demand at point F over to price A.
2. Profit will be rectangle AFGB
3. The monopolist will produce in the elastic range of the curve if left alone or to the left of where MR hits the quantity axis or where MR is positive. (see graph below)
4. Allocative efficiency will occur at MC=D=P or point J, also called Socially Optimal
5. Deadweight loss would be triangle FJH
6. Fair return would occur at point L, where ATC=D=P

#### Natural Monopoly
1. If unregulated the monopoly will profit max going to MR=MC up to the Monopoly price
2. The Socially Optimal or Allocative Efficient price is where MC=D=P. Notice the firm would lose money here as they are producing below the ATC curve at point r.
3. The Fair-return price occurs where ATC=D=P at point f, the firm would break-even here achieving accounting, but not economic profit.
4. Notice the relative flatness of the ATC and MC curves as the Natural Monopolist is usually as bigger firm that uses economies of scale to make an industry with large fixed costs cheaper for everyone by spreading fixed costs among more consumers (example: an electric company spreading fixed costs for a power plant, telephone poles, wires, etc. over a large area to many customers makes the fixed costs cheaper per person and thus the power cheaper)
6. If a firm is producing on the initial downward sloping part of itâ€™s ATC (shown as LRAC on below graph) it is producing with economies of scale.

#### Price Discriminating Monopoly
1. The perfectly price discriminating monopoly is on the right.
2. It will charge the Allocative or Social Optimal price where MC=D=P.
3. This means that there is no deadweight loss!
4. The MR=D because we are charging everyone exactly 5. what they are willing to pay.  That means the profit maximizing rule is followed by the firm at MR=MC=D.
6. There is no Consumer Surplus, only Producer Surplus and notice the difference in the profit on each graph.

#### Monopolistic Competition in Long Run Equilibrium
1. Productively efficient point at min ATC
2. Allocatively efficient point at MR = MB (Marginal Benefit, D=AR=P) 
3. Profit maximizing rule (MR=MC) at Q<sub>f</sub>
4. Profit max up to demand, firm will charge price P<sub>f</sub> (MR=MC)
* __Excess Capacity__: horizontal distance from the point we are producing at to min ATC
* Dead weight loss: triangle including points where MR=MC, MC=DARP, Q<sub>?</sub>=P<sub>?</sub>
