# Basic Economic Concepts
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)

#### Scarcity
Economic trade-offs arise from scarcity to meet societyâ€™s
__wants__ and __needs__.

Factors of production are scarce (Land, Labor, Capital), but established knowledge isn't because it is non-rival.

#### Resource Allocation and Economic Systems
* What goods and services to produce?
* How to produce goods and services?
* Who consumes these goods and services?

The above are significantly indfluenced depending on economic system (command, market, mixed economy)

#### Production Possibilities Curve
* The PPC is a model used to show the trade-offs associated with allocating resources.
* The PPC can be used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, underutilized resources, and economic growth or contraction.
* The shape of the PPC depends on whether opportunity costs are constant, increasing, or decreasing.
* The PPC can shift due to changes in factors of production as well as changes in productivity/technology.
* Economic growth results in an outward shift of the PPC.

#### Comparative Advantage and Trade
##### Absolute Advantage
A situation in which an individual, business, or country can produce more of a good or service than any other producer with the same quantity of resources.
##### Comparative Advantage
A situation in which an individual, business, or country can produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another producer.
##### Terms of Trade
The interval between the opportunity costs for the production of a given good of two companies or nations.

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
##### Opportunity Cost
What is lost when not choosing the next best thing
##### Implicit Costs
Opportunity Costs (what is lost by not choosing an alternative)
##### Explicit Costs
Expenses paid with a company's own tangible assets.
##### Utility
Satisfaction gained

__Total Net Benefits = Total Benefits - Total Costs__
<br>^maximized at the optimal choice
##### Marginal Utility
Satisfaction gained by __one more unit__

#### Marginal Analysis and Consumer Choice

![text](https://enviroliteracy.org/wp-content/uploads/images/page-spec/MCMB%20graph.jpg)

In a model of rational consumer choice, consumers are assumed to make choices so as to maximize their total utility.

##### Diminishing Marginal Utility
Law that states as consumption of goods & services _increases_ the Marginal Utility gained from each additional unit _decreases_.
