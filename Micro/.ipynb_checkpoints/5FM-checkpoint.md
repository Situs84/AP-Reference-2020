#### Introduction to Factor Markets
* Factors of production (land, labor, capital) respond to factor prices (rent, wages, interest) and employers' (firms') decision to hire is based on the productivity of the factors, output price, and cost of the factor.
* The Q of labor demandid is negatively related to wage rate, while the Q of labor supplied is positivitely related to the wage rate in a given labor market, other things constant.

#### Changes in Factor Demand and Factor Supply
* Changes in the determinants of labor demand (such as output price and worker productivity) cause the labor demand curve to shift.
* Changes in the determinants of labor supplpy (immigration, education, working conditions, age distribution, availability of alternative options, preferences for leisure, and cultural expectations) cause the labor supply curve to shift.

#### Profit-Maximizing Behavior in Perfectly Competitive Factor Markets
* In a perfectly competitive labor market, the wage is set by the market (__price takers__)
* ##### Each firm hires the quantity of workers where Marginal factor cost (MRC) = Marginal Revenue Product of labor__. 
* A typical firm may be a perfect competitor in the labor market even if it is an imperfect competitor in its output market.
* A typical firm hires labor in a perfectly competitive labor market as long as the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP<sub>L</sub>) is greater than the market wage.
* To minimize costs or maximize profits, firms allocate inputs such that the last dollar spend on each input yields the same amount of marginal product.

##### Calculating Marginal Revenue Product
* ![MRP = Delta TR / Delta Q](images/MRP1.png)
* MRP = MP â€¢ MR
    * ###### MP - Marginal Physical Product

#### Monopsonistic Markets
###### My teacher says this will not be covered in the exam, but I'm including it anyway because this is one of the officially included units.
* In a monopsonistic labor market, a typical firm hires additional labor as long as the marginal revenue product is greater than the marginal factor (resource) cost (the wage of a new unit of labor plus the wage increase given to all existing labor).
* When a typical firm hires additional workers in a monopsonistic labor market, the marginal factor (resource) cost is greater than the supply price of labor.
