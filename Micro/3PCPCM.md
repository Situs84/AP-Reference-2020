# Production, Cost, and the Perfect Competition Model
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)

#### The Production Function
Firms' production and cost constraints over different input and output levels shape optimal decisions in the short run and long run.
* Explains relationship between inputs and outputs both in the short and long run
* Marginal product and average product change as input usage changes, and hence, total product changes
* __Diminishing Marginal Returns__ occur as the firm employs more of one unit, holding other inputs constant, to produce a product (output) in the short run

---

#### __Short-Run__ Production Costs
* FCs and VCs determine total cost
* MC, AFC, AVC, ATC, TC, and TVC change as total output changes but TFC remains constant at all output levels, including zero output.
* Production functions with diminishing marginal returns yield an __upward-sloping marginal cost curve__.
* Specialization and division of labor reduce MCs for firms
* Cost curves can shift in response to changes in input costs and productivity

#### __Long-Run__ Production Costs
* Because firms can adjust all inputs, all costs become variable
* The relationship between inputs and outputs in LR is described by scale of production
    * increasing returns to scale if &Delta;Input < &Delta;Output
    * constant returns to scale if &Delta;Input = &Delta;Output
    * decreasing returns to scale if &Delta;Input > &Delta;Output
* ATC in LR (__LRAC__) is characterized by economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, or constant returns to scale (efficient scale)

#### Types of Profit
* ##### Economic Profit
    * = TR - (Explicit + Implicit Costs)
    * Firms respond to economic profit (loss) rather than accounting profit
* ##### Accounting Profit
    * Monetary profit (I'd consider it raw profit, though it's not entirely accurate)
    * Fails to account for implicit costs (cost of financial capital, compensation for risk, entreperneur's time) which, if fully compensated, result in normal profit
* ##### Normal Profit
    * Occurs when Economic Profit = 0
    * Means all resources are being used efficienctly

#### Profit Maximization
Firms are assumed to produce output to maximize their profits by comparing __MR__ to __MC__.

---
#### Firms' Short-Run Decisions to Produce and Long-Run decisions to Enter or Exit a Market
These decisions are based on profitability
* In SR, firms decide to operate (positive output) or shut down (zero output) by comparing TR to TVC or P to AVC (min AVC is shutdown point)
* In LR (with no barriers to exit or entry) firms enter a market in which there are profit-making opportunities and exit a market when they anticipate economic losses

---

#### __Perfect Competition__
* A perfectly competitive market is efficient. Firms face no barriers to entry and have no market power.
* Prices communicate to consumers and producers the magnitude of others' MC of production and marginal benefits of consumption and provide incentives to act on that information
    * __P=MC__
    * At equilibrium, firms are __price takers__
* At mkt equilibrium, firms select output to maximize profit by prodicing the level of output where MR = MC (at P)
* P = Private Marginal Benefit and P = Private Marginal Cost, thus achieving __Allocative Efficiency__
* In a <u>short run</u> equilibrium, price can either be above or below the long-run level, motivating exit/entry of firms and moving P and Q torwards long-run equilibrium
* In a <u>long run</u> equilibrium, productive efficiency implies all operating firms produce at efficient scale, meaning P=MC=min ATC and firms earn zero economic profit
* Firms may be in a constant cost, increasing cost, or decreasing cost industry. Long-run prices depend on the portion of the long-run cost curves on which firms operate.
* A perfectly competitive market in long-run equilibrium is __allocatively and productively efficient__.
